# Hi

## This is my NoSQL with Apache Cassandra repo.

### Here modeled a song dataset by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries.

### The dataset is based on the start-up, Sparkify

####  Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

#### They'd like us to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions. Your role in this problem is to create a database for this analysis.

#### Rest of the expenation is under construction!
